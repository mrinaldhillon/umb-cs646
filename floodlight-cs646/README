CS646 Hw1:
1. Setup:
  - build floodlight.
    First time after a fresh clone or checkout:
      git clone https://github.com/floodlight/floodlight 
      cd floodlight
      git submodule init                # pull down web-ui files
      git submodule update 
      ant                                       # compile **after** fetching web-ui files
      java -jar target/floodlight.jar # start controller
  - cd hw1  # dependencies - compiled floodlight(master) in parent dir. 
    ant  # build
    ant run   #runs floodlight with mycontroller module
    ant debug # run in debug mode, hardcode socket address for jdb is 6767
2. Infrastructure:
  - Idea is to maintain floodlight as a submodule while controllers are maintained outside
    floodlight repo. This way floodlight stays clean while we can much around as much
    under homeworks.
  - At compile time classpath is set to floodlight.jar.
  - For packaging floodlight.jar is packaged with floodlight-cs646.jar.
  - Important files: hw1/src/main/resources/* are copied for corresponding path under floodlight with MyController information added to properties and modules.
